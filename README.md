# Coding Interview Code

Partially inspired by the [Coding Interview University](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university), here's where I'll be putting my completed assignments. I may overcomplicate/overengineer some solutions in order to gain more experience/understanding of the C language.

 - [ ] Dynamic Programming (`/dynamic_programming/`)
	- [x] Fibonacci Sequence
	- [ ] Ugly Numbers
